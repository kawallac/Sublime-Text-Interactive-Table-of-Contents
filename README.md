# Sublime-Text-Interactive-Table-of-Contents
This plugin for Sublime Text is an interactive table of contents for markdown files. When activated the  plugin reads the current markdown file and generates a table of contents from the headings. The table  of contents is interactive. By clicking a heading in the table of contents it will take the cursor to that spot in the document.
